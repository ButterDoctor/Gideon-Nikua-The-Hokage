            <p><small>THERE ARE MANY FOODS THAT CROWD OUR WORLD. THE AMOUNT OF FOOD AND THE KINDS OF FOOD YOU EAT IS KEY TO ATTAINING PROPER HEALTH. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH, IT WOULD BE BEST TO STRAY AWAY FROM FOODS LIKE MC DONALDS OR ANY FAST FOOD IN GENERAL. THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU NEED TO COMPLETELY TAKE THIS OUT OF YOUR DIET, BUT INSTEAD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FAST FOOD YOU CONSUME. ITS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION THAT YOU SHOULD BE CUTTING FAST FOOD COMPLETELY, BUT HEALTHY EATING IS MOSTLY CALORIE TRACKING AND TRACKING THE NUTRIENTS IN THE FOOD YOU EAT. THIS IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO CHECK THE INFORMATION ON THE FOOD THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO CONSUME.</small></p>

            <p><small>WHAT YOU ARE ADDING INTO YOUR MEALS IS ALSO A FACTOR THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR HEALTH. ADDING EXTRA FACTORS INTO YOUR FOOD LIKE, DIFFERENT SAUCES OR EVEN DIFFERENT SEASONINGS, CAN ADD THINGS LIKE SODIUM AND CALORIES THAT COULD LEAD TO UNKNOWN WEIGHT GAIN. THE FINAL TIP ON FOOD THAT I WOULD GIVE WOULD BE TO COUNT YOUR CALORIES. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO LOSE UNWANTED WEIGHT, I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND TRACKING YOUR CALORIES. TO DO THIS YOU WOULD HAVE TO FIND THE CALORIES THAT YOU TAKE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN YOUR BODY WEIGHT, THEN MAKE SURE YOU EAT BELOW THE AMOUNT THAT YOU NEED TO EAT TO MAINTAIN.</small></p>
