          <p><small>THROUGHOUT MY LIFE I HAVE TRIED TO KEEP A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE SO HERE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE HELPED ME SO FAR. IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, I HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT WITH POWERLIFTING. THIS IS A SPORT THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF WEIGHT LIFTING, IN ORDER TO BUILD STRENGTH AND ATTAIN HEAVY LIFTS. I RECOMMEND THIS SPORT TO ANYONE WHO MAY BE LOOKING INTO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THIS ACTIVITY ASSISTS IN GAINING STRENGTH OVER TIME AND ALSO IMPROVING THE APPEARANCE OF YOUR PHYSIQUE. BUT YOU MUST BE CAREFUL WHEN LIFTING, AS LIFTING WEIGHTS THAT YOU ARE NOT READY FOR COULD LEAD TO INJURY. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP YOUR FORM CONSISTENT TO AVOID INJURY.</small></p>

          <p><small>AS FOR MY DIETING, I MAINLY ENSURE THAT I AM TRACKING MY CALORIES, WHILE EATING UNDER THE AMOUNT OF CALORIES THAT I NEED TO EAT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN MY BODY WEIGHT. IN MY OVERALL EXPERIENCE, THE TYPES OF FOOD DID NOT REALLY HAVE MUCH OF AN EFFECT ON HOW I KEPT MY BODY HEALTHY. I WAS ABLE TO BUILD MUSCLE AND LOSE UNECESSARY BODY FAT BY EATING ANY FOODS BUT ENSURING I DID NOT GO OVER THE CALORIES I EAT TO MAINTAIN MY BODY WEIGHT.  </small></p>
